<h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

This application was created using Node.Js and the inquirer module. 
My aim was to create an easy to use and simple README generator, that users can open in their command terminal. 
This application allows the user to enter in their README information, via prompts given in the command terminal, and have 
their input transfered into a professional README.md file. 
This allows users to spend more time on their code, and less time on creating a README file.

***
<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

1. Download Node.js
2. Download this module
3. In the cmd line, navigate to the root directory and run "npm init"

<h2 id="use">Usage</h2>
