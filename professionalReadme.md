<h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

This is an easy to use README.md file generator. Created with the intention of making README file creation quick and easy

 To save time writing README files and to get familiar with Node.js. 

 I want to have an easy and fast way to write a professional README.md for my projects, so i can spend more time on writing code..

 i learned how to use Node.js and the inquirer package.

 The biggest challenge was finding the correct license information .

 I hope to add more sections and expand my README file writing knowledge so i can make the generated READMEs better as I learn.
