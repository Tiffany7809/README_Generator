  <h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

  This is an app that quickly and easiliy creates a README Document given user input.

  I wanted to make writing a README file quick and easy.. 

  Writing a README and formatting it takes up precious time that could be spent coding the actual project..

  I learned how to use Node.js and the inquirer package of npm.

  The biggest challenge for me was figuringout how to implement Node and run JS in the CMD line. it all felt very new to me..

  I plan to add more detailed questions and more sections to the README prompt..
